	    <p>A little boy lay wide awake one night, watching, listening. The closet door was open a crack from which a darkness peered out, but he did not dare go over and close it. The monster under the bed made sure of that. The boy did not dare move, though his head itched. He did not dare cry out, though he could hear his parents snoring. The closet door creaked as an icy breeze blew forth. Behind that darkness, hid the frozen man, whose purple-black flesh was cold and hard, cracked like porcelain.</p>
	    <p>So the story goes that once upon a time, the frozen man was not so frozen, but an ordinary man living in an ordinary town. He did ordinary things and thought ordinary thoughts. His voice was soft and deep. His flesh was tender and warm. He was a logger, who went up and down those logging roads in those mountains full of logs. Felled those tall trees with his saw and axe, and skid those long logs back into town. Up and down those logging roads, he sang in that soft, deep voice of his. He sang to the birds and the ferns and the bears and the trees, who all stopped to secretly listen. He sang to himself, who so desperately longed for warmth, a warmth that he could only sing to himself.</p>
	    <p>In town, he drank warm soup, ate warm bread, sat by warm fires and talked to warm people, but even so, he always felt cold. People had warm hands and warm breaths, but their words sounded so terribly cold to him. They talked about the weather, they talked about the government, they talked about foolish men and pretty women, they talked about money and taxes, they sold insurance and snake oils, bought jewelery and alcohol. But surrounded by all these people, he could not figure out why he still felt so cold inside. So he sighed, and watched all this pass him by, softly singing to himself.</p>
	    <p>One day, he found himself once again singing to those mountain roads. Softly he sang about a place he had once heard of. It was somewhere far, far away, where it was really, really warm, down to the marrow of his bones. He slipped slowly into this dream as he walked on and on with his axe over one shoulder. Step after step took him closer to this faraway land, and so deeply he fell into this dream that he did not notice that the air had grown cold and silent. He looked around and saw that there was no a longer a road nor path, only those swaying trees that creaked as an icy chill blew forth. The usual echo of hammered wedges and two-man saws had disappeared many miles ago. The rabbits and woodpeckers had gone away into their little hiding holes. If he had stayed and chatted in town, he would have listened to the word on the street that a terrible blizzard was rolling in, but he had only watched and sang, never listened to those cold words. The people in town never did find him. And all they had left to do was tell the story of the cold, cold man who froze to death in the mountains.</p>
