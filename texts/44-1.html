	    <p>Once upon a time, a little sailboat sailed far, far away. A snowshoe hare laid very quietly on the sailboat's deck, listening to the ocean's hollow beat. Way past the horizon, there must have been glistening skylines and sawtooth mountain ranges. But here, there were only dark waves dimly reflecting a waxing crescent moon and a dozen forgotten constellations. The hare drifted in and out of sleep, wondering how he arrived here, so far from everything he once knew and loved.</p>
	    <p>It felt like a lifetime ago that a young snowshoe hare had left his litter behind and gone out into the world alone. Youthful longings drove the hare far and wide. He found new types of pinecones, new colours of lakes, new shapes of rocks, and new songs of new birds. New friends too, so many rabbits young and old he had never met before, who came from all the home-rabbit-towns far and wide. And so, among friends, he leaped and bounded through many meadowgrasses, chased and was chased over many clear-blue creeks. The snowshoe hare had never had so much fun. And though he slept alone at night amongst hollow logs and brush thickets, he dreamt away the glowing night sky with fantasies of a happy future in this meadow of friends.</p>
	    <p>One day, he chased behind a black-tailed jackrabbit who he fancied most beautiful. She darted between alpine wildflowers as he followed desperately behind. Alas, she proved too fast for him and was lost amidst the trees. Hare wandered about aimlessly a while calling out to jackrabbit, before hearing something horrible in the distance. Towards what sounded like a terrible beast's deep snarl and jackrabbit's harrowing scream, snowshoe hare ran as fast as he could toward its source. He reached jackrabbit just in time to see her backing up against a sheer cliff, cornered by a pack of snarling grey wolves.</p>
	    <p>Snowshoe hare had never seen such terrifying creatures. They had scraggly pelts marred by wounds both old and new, long rows of blood-stained teeth, and a paralyzing stare that betrayed no sympathy. He saw jackrabbit, jackrabbit saw him, and they locked eyes for one long moment. And though everything he remembered about his mother told him to run away and never look back, he knew that he could never live with himself, leaving his dear jackrabbit to die. And so, something in her desperately pleading eyes compelled him to dash madly between the grey wolve's paws and embrace her, knocking them both flying down toward the valley.</p>
	    <p>They tumbled about for what felt like forever. The wolves snarled and watched their own drool join dozens of loose rocks in following their prey a thousand feet down. Snowshoe hare and black-tailed jackrabbit shut their eyes tight and held each other tighter
	    <p>"Hold on tight!" said snowshoe hare.</p>
	    <p>"I'll never let you go!" responded black-tailed jackrabbit.</p>
	    <p>And all of a sudden, they hit the ground with a muffled crunch. Jackrabbit opened her eyes slowly to see that they had been caught gently by a slushy patch of snow, leftover from the long winter and softened by the afternoon sun.
	    <p>"My God, you came back for me!"</p>
	    <p>A dazed snowshoe hare slowly opened his eyes and found his favourite jackrabbit on top of him inside a hare-shaped hole in the snow. She brushed his whiskers and showered him with kisses.
	    <p>"Gee, what happened?"</p>
	    <p>"You saved me, so bravely, so now I love you, most dearly."</p>
	    <p>She pulled him out of the snow and kissed him again.</p>
	    <p>He stood up on his hind legs to marvel at the height they had fallen, from the top of that sheer granite face.</p>
	    <p>"Wow, we fell from all the way up there?"</p>
	    <p>"Yes, but you kept me safe. I'll never forget that."</p>
	    <p>So black-tailed jackrabbit followed snowshoe rabbit around everywhere he went. She tailed him as they stomped over alpine wildflowers and parted soft meadowgrasses. She even slept beneath the same thickets, inside of the same hollow logs as him. They were inseparable, like </p>
