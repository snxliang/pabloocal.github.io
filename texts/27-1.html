	    <p>Once upon a time, there was a king who was very sad. The sad king daily went about his matters joylessly, as if compelled to move by an invisible puppeteer. Faultlessly, he would keep his affairs in order, ensure the people were fed and entertained. The nobles and peasants alike admired him. He was a good ruler, strong yet merciful, sympathetic yet pragmatic. In all interactions, such as at royal feasts, his conduct was humble and pleasant. At such a feast, though, one might observe the sad king laughing a bit more quietly and smiling a bit more rigidly than all the nobles surrounding him, whose drunken jests could be heard echoing throughout the castle corridors. Rich lords and merchants would prod him with drinks and games. Behind his back in too loud a whisper, they mocked his reticence and joked that he ought to find himself a woman, no shortage of whom would gladly make herself queen. So many beautiful courtesans tempted him in sweet tones and pretty dresses, only to be turned down most politely.</p>
	    <p>One time, the sad king appeared at a small tavern where tradesmen nightly gathered to drink. He traded his velvet cloak for a cotton tunic and shaved his beard so that he would not be recognized. If the men in the tavern saw through his disguise, they did not care to show it. Together they drank and ate and laughed. At sundown, these men drank with dirty paws as respite from a long days work cobbling shoes, tilling fields, and smithing tools. But by the end of the night, with gleaming faces and slurred speech, they drank their last glasses gleefully to next dawn's morning light. A brighter tomorrow that brought promise of the same arduous labour rewarded with the same feverish joy. The sad king joined in and found himself slapped on the back and jostled about just as if he had known these men all his life. Together, they staggered and stumbled through uneven streets, wildly singing strange songs whose lyrics they already knew. The men disappeared one-by-one into the darkness of night, retreating to their respective quarters for restful nights until the sad king found himself, once again, all alone, with only the night sky's cold company. He made the long trek back to his castle where he knew he knew he would keep himself up all night with those terribly oppressive thoughts.</p>
	    <p>Doubtless, all the lords and nobles noticed the castellan's strange state. Although they could not understand it, why so enviable a man would be so indifferent to his gifts, they could see that something was wrong. They worried for the future of the kingdom, for they could sense well enough the degree to which the kingdom had come to depend on the king's humour. Thus, they came together and organized a great festival. From faraway lands, artisans and entertainers, wizards and quacks, suitresses and soothsayers, were invited. Whispers spread of the capital's great festival capital until all the kingdom had heard, all except the sad king, who observed with dismissed curiosity his acquaintances' conspicuous glances and over-friendly banter.</p>
	    <p>So it went, that on a cloudy morning, the sad king laid awake in bed listening to the gentle raindrops of an impending storm, that his tranquil was interrupted by an eruption of bugles and a crowd that cheered upon his appearance at his window. A sea of shiny-wet cloaks dotted with gleaming faces stared up at him. A band played as the portcullis was drawn and the vast crowd parted to make way for the armoured elephants and sequinned dancers. The great parade marched on through packed streets as the noise drew more and more people from their homes and into the pouring rain. The sad king watched all this with a profound mixture of emotions he had never felt before. Lightning flashed across the sky and everything went silent. Thunder struck a chord in the crowd, roared back to life. Mud-splattered children screamed and laughed as they chased and were chased through deep puddles, the maze of packed cobblestone alleys. The sad king smiled when he saw that everybody had forgotten about him and were contented, rather, by the festive chaos. Even the sky could not help but join in on the rumble.
