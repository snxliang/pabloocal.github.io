	    <p>You said that you know ways to make me happier and more serene. But you don't ask whether that as what I really want.</p>
	    <p>It was one those days so long that morning seemed a lifetime away. One of those nights I found myself sitting at the end of the world, feet dangling way above the rugged shore. Somewhere along the way, without even realizing it, I had left my life behind. The bed I laid in and the friends I laughed with, the vapours I slept with and the arms I cried in. And so, here, at the end of the world, where earth gives way to infinite sea, a restless mind has only nobody to talk to.</p>
	    <p>Why are you here?</p> nobody asked.
	    <p>I don't know, said I.</p>
	    <p>Everybody who arrives at the end of the world has a reason.</p>
	    <p>Not me, I left mine behind.</p>
	    <p>That's too bad, I like reasons.</p>
	    <p>If it means so much to you, perhaps I'll just make one up for you.</p>
	    <p>Oh but those wouldn't be real reasons.</p>
	    <p>Who's to say what's real? Maybe I just wanted to go somewhere to be alone. How suffocating it is to be around people all the time. People with all their love and despair, who drink each other's hearts up hoping it might fill their own, fill each others hearts up with the wrong gasoline. People are always so full of reasons to help them sleep at night. Discontent with smoking grass and counting sheep, they are sedated by their own delusions. People are always prescribing me my own happiness, as if only their version of it will cure me. People are not good to each other. Only, they lie to themselves that they are. Alas, in solitude alone is there kindness and compassion.</p>
	    <p>It can't be true, you mustn't say things like that!</p>
	    <p>Who's to say what's true? Maybe I just like the the night sky, towering bluffs, and the sound of the ocean, crashing rhythmically ashore.</p>
	    <p>Indeed, that seems a much more agreeable reason to me.</p>
	    <p>Or maybe I came here to play useless word-games with nobody at all.</p>
