	<span class="title"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" href="pdf/8-1.pdf">8-1 Chinatown</a></span> (2022-02) - Wrote this in LA because I was bored. Story about growing up in Chinatown, Los Angeles. Written by somebody who didn't even grow up in Los Angeles. <br><br>

	<span class="title"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" href="pdf/7-1a.pdf">7-1 A Story About Airplanes</a></span> (2021-11) - Wrote this during a gerontology lecture because I was bored. Just a very straightforward story about airplanes and literally nothing else. This is simultaneously my favourite and least favourite story I've written.<br><br>

	<span class="title"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" href="pdf/5-1.pdf">5-1 The Shorter Metamorphosis</a></span> (2021-10) - Wrote this for a 500 word scary story contest but never submitted it because it's not very scary. It's like Kafka's <i>Die Vanderlung</i> but way shorter, a bit angstier, and instead of a dude who turns into a bug, it's a teenage girl (or boy) who turns into a vial of barbital.<br><br>

	<span class="title"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" href="pdf/1-1.pdf">1-1 Pilot</a></span> (2021-06) - Wrote this in 12th grade biology class because I was bored. The story that started it all. About a very frustrated and existentially confused anti-consumerist boy clearing out a childhood of mass-produced goods. Needs a lot of editing. Also needs to be re-scanned properly.<br><br>

	<span class="heading">Non-fiction</span><br><br>

	<span class="title"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" href="pdf/TragedyHK.pdf">The Tragedy of Hong Kong</a></span> (2021-03) - Grade 12 English assignment with a rather restrictive word-limit where we had to write an op-ed on a topic of our choice. Did not get a very good grade on this one. Probably one of my better rhetorical pieces though. <br><br>

	<span class="title"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" href="pdf/ConeNotes.pdf">Understanding the Volume of a Cone</a></span> (2021-01) - Short hand-written explainer on the volume of a cone. Just for fun.<br><br>

	<span class="title"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" href="pdf/CapitalFlight.pdf">Chinese Capital Flight</a></span> (2020-11) - Grade 12 Economics assignment to write an essay on a topic of our choice. <br><br>
